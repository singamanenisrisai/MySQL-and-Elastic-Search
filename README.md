# Comparision Between MySQL-and-Elastic-Search
### This repository is a comparision of execution time and complexity between MySQL and Elastic Search.
#### Four different scenarios of data has been made and Queries are performed for each scenario and captured the response time for both MySQL and ElasticSearch.
#### According to our queries and response time which we obtained, we observed that ElasticSearch runs faster on more complex dataset.
#### Finally, comparing both the response times of MySQL and Elastic search, we analysed that queries in elastic search executed more rapidly and is better and faster mechanism to retrieve and store data. Although, the implementation in traditional databases are easier than the NoSQL databases.
